      <p>
        Mele is the goodest dog in the world. Just trust me on that Although she
        may do some things that are questionable. She will always be my dog. You
        can't have her sorry >:) Every morning she wakes up at 6:00 to be fed
        and taken out to use the bathroom. After she's done with that she sleeps
        with Alex for a little bit before he wakes up. When he and the rest of
        the family leaves then she sleeps for basically entire day, only waking
        up occasionally to drink some water. She waits paitently for the family
        to get home And when they get home she gets really excited. And once
        everyone gets home she is happy :D. Anyways she hopes you have a good
        rest of the day!
